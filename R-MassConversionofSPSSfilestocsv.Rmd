This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r, function for mass converting converting SPSS files to csv files}

fnConvertSPSStoCSV<- function(filepath){

library(foreign)

setwd(filepath)

files <- list.files(path = filepath, pattern = '.sav')# Declare path of the files here
for(f in files) {
  data1 <-read.spss(f, to.data.frame=TRUE,use.value.labels=FALSE) #Reading this to a dataframe
  write.csv(data, paste0(strsplit(f, split = '.', fixed =  T)[[1]][1], '.csv'))
}
}


#Sample below
fnConvertSPSStoCSV('C:\\Users\\ForConversion')

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
